Data Observations
---------------------------
1. Capomulin is the only drug out of the three drugs and placebo we analyzed that showed positive results. Tumor volume reduced and the most number of mice survived under Capomulin.
2. Ketapril seemed to have the opposite of the desired effect; tumor volume was larger under Ketapril vs. Placebo.
3. Similarly, Infubinol also had a negetive effect on the mice tumors; more mice did not survive under Infubinol vs. Placebo.
